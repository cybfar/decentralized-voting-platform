# Decentralized Voting Platform

This project is a decentralized voting platform built using Vue.js, Solidity, and Web3.js. It enables users to securely cast their votes on various topics while ensuring transparency and immutability through blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Decentralization**: The platform operates on a decentralized network, ensuring transparency and eliminating the need for a central authority.
- **Security**: Votes are securely recorded on the blockchain, preventing tampering or manipulation.
- **Immutable Ledger**: The blockchain maintains an immutable ledger of all votes cast, providing an auditable record of the voting process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The platform offers a user-friendly interface built with Vue.js, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Solidity**: A contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Web3.js**: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling communication between the frontend and the blockchain.
